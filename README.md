# Green Scores

This repo is for [Filecoin Green](https://green.filecoin.io)'s work on developing Green Scores for Storage Providers as an output of our [Auditing Process](https://filecoin-green.gitbook.io/filecoin-green-documentation/readme-1/storage-providers-tiered-sustainability-claims). 

This work is complementary to the [Reporting Portal](https://filecoin-green.gitbook.io/filecoin-green-documentation/readme-1/additional-resources/annex-3-filecoin-green-reporting-portal) we are devloping to streamline the reporting requirements and verification process.

These Green Scores will likely be packaged as [Hypercerts](hypercerts.xyz), and may be tied to incentives for decarbonization such as a boost in reputation score, or other economic benefits.
